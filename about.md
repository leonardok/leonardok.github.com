<h1>{{ page.title }}</h1>

My name is Leonardo and I'm a Computer Science Undergrad at [UFRGS](http://ufrgs.br).
I'm a Linux user since long time now - unfortunately I don’t have the time to 
keep testing a lot of distros anymore, and don’t have the time to contribute 
with open source projects, even that I have a lot of will of doing it.

It was after 2006 that, when I bought a Mac, left Linux over the mac (for 
desktop I must say. Still my preferred development operating system.) I still 
have some virtual machines with Slackware (wich is my favorite) and an 
ArchLinux, that I maintain alive.

Since the begging of graduation (2004/2) I have worked with:

- I currently work at T&T (not AT&T) in a Ruby on Rails awesome secret project. 
But I've also worked with: Embedded operating systems and storage 
virtualization, in the HP Enterprise Virtual Arrays (a.k.a. EVA), a storage 
solution with 5 9's; In HP SSTK for HP Integrity system.

- At Instaladora Elétrica Mercurio, I helped developing an ERP with PHP and 
MySQL, that runs the entrire company, taking care of (control) all (at least at
the time) resourses, time-tracking, stock... Pretty much everything.

- Then at CWI Software as C developer, I have outsourced my working hours to 
Terra Networks, helping them to develop their support center. It was aimed at 
the internal support team, a management system for subscribers.

- At Digistar, where I was intern of engineering, worked with C development, 
little stuffs in C++ and a lot of Linux. Awesome company, great people!
Began as intern at UNISINOS, on something that we call "cientific initiation". 
It's basically helping on research. You do what the smart people say, and you 
learn a lot. PIPCA (Programa Programa de Pós Graduação em Computação Aplicada da
Universidade do Vale do Rio dos Sinos - UNISINOS/RS). I have worked with high 
performance computing there.

I have also:

Tried to build my own company focusing in development with Ruby on Rails and web
applications. It didn't worked out because I had to dedicate myself to 
university. Start-ups demand lots of time. It's was a very intense experience.
