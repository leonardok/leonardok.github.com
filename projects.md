You can check my GitHub page for all my public projects @ 
<a href="http://github.com/leonardok/">github.com/leonardok</a>.

At some point there was more projects, but you know, they kinda go with the wind
and only some persist through the times. ![alt text](/images/icon_sad.gif)
 
## [Retriever](https://github.com/leonardok/Retriev.er)
Retriever is a YAGFR (yet another GUI for rsync) that aims at been simple and do 
remote rsync. It's still in early stage of development, but it's very usable. 
The application icon is a young Golden Retriever, because it's designed to 
"retrieve" stuff backed up in online servers and because is still a baby 
application.

To have a look at the application you can visit its page at 
github.com/leokorndorfer/Retriev.er. There you'll find an issue tracker and a 
Wiki (but please, don't expect completness.)
