## [Retriever](http://github.com/leonardok/Retriev.er)
Retriever is a GUI for rsync that aims at been simple and do 
remote rsync. It's still in early stage of development, but it's very usable. 
The application icon is a young Golden Retriever, because it's designed to 
"retrieve" stuff backed up in online servers and because is still a baby 
application.

To have a look at the application you can visit its page at 
github.com/leokorndorfer/Retriev.er. There you'll find a Wiki and a nissue 
tracker where you can fill bugs and requests.
