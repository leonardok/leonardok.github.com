<h2>Retriever</h2>
Retriever is a YAGFR (yet another GUI for rsync) that aims at been simple and do 
remote rsync. It's still in early stage of development, but it's very usable. 
The application icon is a young Golden Retriever, because it's designed to 
"retrieve" stuff backed up in online servers and because is still a baby 
application.

To have a look at the application you can visit its page at 
github.com/leokorndorfer/Retriev.er. There you'll find an issue tracker and a 
Wiki (but please, don't expect completness.) 

<h2>Quadro de Vagas</h2>
This project is a website to people add job ads for free. Again, focused on simplicity, for both users and companies, to add and propagate job offers.

<h2>Lentes e Cameras</h2>
(Lenses and Cameras) This website is aimed for people to add their camera gear they want to sell, so others can see. It has the same engine as the Quadro de Vagas, and it's only for helping people to find what they want.
