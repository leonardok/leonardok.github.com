This is just an unboxing of the Mustang Mini imported to Brazil. I will just
add the pictures here. This amp is really something. Firt impressions where
that it is well built, smaller than I tought it to be too.

As I bought it to use with headphones in the apartment, size really matters
to me. Also has a battery compartment behing. I will put up some specs.

- Wattage: 7 Watts
- Plugs: FTSW (P10), Input (P10), Headphones (P2), Aux (P2), Mini USB
- Depth: 6.69" (17 cm)
- Width: 9.45" (24 cm)
- Height: 9.45" (24 cm)
- Weight: 7.25 lbs. (3.3 kg)
- 6.5" Speaker
- Input Power Source: AC power supply (included 110-240V) or six C batteries
- Digital output through USB

Mostly from [Fender website](http://www.fender.com/series/mustang/mustang-mini-120v/)


You can also use Fender FUSE to change or tweek existing effects. This is
really cool, I spend more time creating effects than playing sometimes.
